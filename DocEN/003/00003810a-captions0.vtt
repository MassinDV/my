>> NARRATOR: November 2019,
Afghanistan.

01:01.830 --> 01:05.030 align:left position:10%,start line:85% size:80%
Journalist Najibullah Quraishi
is making a dangerous journey

01:05.030 --> 01:09.330 align:left position:10%,start line:85% size:80%
into Taliban territory.
>> We just left Kabul.

01:09.330 --> 01:14.230 align:left position:10%,start line:85% size:80%
Our driver was warning, saying
there are going to be Taliban,

01:14.230 --> 01:16.900 align:left position:10%,start line:85% size:80%
it's going to be a problem for
you.

01:16.900 --> 01:22.930 align:left position:10%,start line:85% size:80%
Those big holes are all from the
IED explosions.

01:22.930 --> 01:25.270 align:left position:10%,start line:85% size:80%
>> NARRATOR: Najibullah has been
covering the war here for almost

01:25.270 --> 01:28.330 align:left position:10%,start line:85% size:80%
20 years.
(gunfire)

01:28.330 --> 01:32.130 align:left position:10%,start line:85% size:80%
He was here in 2001 when the
U.S. and its allies invaded and

01:32.130 --> 01:36.800 align:left position:10%,start line:85% size:80%
drove the Taliban from power.
In the decade that followed,

01:36.800 --> 01:39.770 align:left position:10%,start line:85% size:80%
they filmed many times with the
Taliban as they fought back and

01:39.770 --> 01:43.270 align:left position:10%,start line:85% size:80%
regained territory across the
country.

01:43.270 --> 01:46.430 align:left position:10%,start line:85% size:80%
And in 2015, he met with ISIS
fighters when the group was

01:46.430 --> 01:50.430 align:left position:10%,start line:85% size:80%
first emerging here.
Now, Najibullah has returned to

01:50.430 --> 01:53.470 align:left position:10%,start line:85% size:80%
his home country at a critical
moment.

01:53.470 --> 01:57.170 align:left position:10%,start line:85% size:80%
President Trump has committed to
end America's longest war, and

01:57.170 --> 02:01.830 align:left position:10%,start line:85% size:80%
has even been negotiating a
peace deal with the Taliban.

02:01.830 --> 02:04.430 align:left position:10%,start line:85% size:80%
But the situation on the ground
remains violent and

02:04.430 --> 02:08.800 align:left position:10%,start line:85% size:80%
unpredictable.
>> The driver is telling me, the

02:08.800 --> 02:12.730 align:left position:10%,start line:85% size:80%
day before yesterday, there was
three explosions.

02:12.730 --> 02:17.230 align:left position:10%,start line:85% size:80%
They put an IED, and mainly for
the government vehicles.

02:18.800 --> 02:20.630 align:left position:10%,start line:85% size:80%
>> NARRATOR: Najibullah is
heading into a Taliban

02:20.630 --> 02:24.070 align:left position:10%,start line:85% size:80%
stronghold near the city of
Ghazni, less than 100 miles from

02:24.070 --> 02:29.870 align:left position:10%,start line:85% size:80%
the capitol, Kabul.
>> This is Ghazni town.

02:29.870 --> 02:33.700 align:left position:10%,start line:85% size:80%
It's under control of the
government, but they control

02:33.700 --> 02:40.130 align:left position:10%,start line:85% size:80%
just the government compound.
Last night was fighting, from

02:40.130 --> 02:42.600 align:left position:10%,start line:85% size:80%
behind these shops.
The Taliban, they were attacking

02:42.600 --> 02:47.800 align:left position:10%,start line:85% size:80%
on the government.
It's mean they are everywhere.

02:47.800 --> 02:50.170 align:left position:10%,start line:85% size:80%
>> NARRATOR: He's had to make a
complicated plan to get into the

02:50.170 --> 02:54.670 align:left position:10%,start line:85% size:80%
Taliban-controlled territory.
>> Must go with the drivers from

02:54.670 --> 02:58.770 align:left position:10%,start line:85% size:80%
the same area, because the car
is known for the Taliban.

02:58.770 --> 03:01.230 align:left position:10%,start line:85% size:80%
This is the car they suggested
to be there.
