It is a hidden crime.

11:20.230 --> 11:21.770 align:left position:10%,start line:85% size:80%

19:51.900 --> 19:53.370 position:10%,start line:85% size:80%
I gotta make sure
you're straight.

19:53.370 --> 19:55.030 position:10%,start line:85% size:80%
I gotta make sure your hair's
done, your nails done,

19:55.030 --> 19:57.600 position:10%,start line:85% size:80%
I gotta make sure
you get your beauty sleep,

19:57.600 --> 20:02.400 position:10%,start line:85% size:80%
I gotta make sure you have
the proper hygiene.

20:02.400 --> 20:05.300 position:10%,start line:85% size:80%
>> The first time
I didn't answer a call,

20:05.300 --> 20:06.630 position:10%,start line:85% size:80%
I had to explain myself
the next morning,

20:06.630 --> 20:09.500 position:10%,start line:85% size:80%
and he had pulled me ad off
immediately

20:09.500 --> 20:12.030 align:left position:10%,start line:85% size:80%
and was screaming at me, because
I didn't answer his call.

20:12.030 --> 20:13.830 position:10%,start line:85% size:80%
>> You know, I gotta take care
of everything.

20:13.830 --> 20:15.030 position:10%,start line:85% size:80%
You know what I mean?

20:15.030 --> 20:16.430 position:10%,start line:85% size:80%
Once everything starts getting
going,

20:16.430 --> 20:17.870 position:10%,start line:85% size:80%
and everything starts
getting good,

20:17.870 --> 20:19.870 position:10%,start line:85% size:80%
it's a really luxury life.

20:19.870 --> 20:22.170 align:left position:10%,start line:85% size:80%
I'm gonna put you in a position
to win.

20:22.170 --> 20:24.100 align:left position:10%,start line:85% size:80%
A happy girl makes happy money.

20:24.100 --> 20:26.330 position:10%,start line:85% size:80%
>> (laughing)

20:26.330 --> 20:27.330 position:10%,start line:85% size:80%
It's all about the money.

20:27.330 --> 20:29.130 position:10%,start line:85% size:80%
It is a business to them.

20:29.130 --> 20:32.700 position:10%,start line:85% size:80%
A drug is a useable quantity
that can be used up one time,

20:32.700 --> 20:35.570 align:left position:10%,start line:85% size:80%
a person can be trafficked over
and over and over again

20:35.570 --> 20:37.070 position:10%,start line:85% size:80%
all day long.

20:37.070 --> 20:38.430 position:10%,start line:85% size:80%
And that's why it's a such
a growing problem.

20:38.430 --> 20:41.130 position:10%,start line:85% size:80%
>> So there he is.
He's responding now.

20:41.130 --> 20:43.730 position:10%,start line:85% size:80%
We have him IDed somewhere.

20:43.730 --> 20:46.730 position:10%,start line:85% size:80%
"What you looking for
in the one you choose?"

20:46.730 --> 20:48.200 position:10%,start line:85% size:80%
Aww.
>> In the one you choose?

20:48.200 --> 20:49.430 position:10%,start line:85% size:80%
>> I mean, this is fantastic.

20:49.430 --> 20:50.970 position:10%,start line:85% size:80%
This is going to give us...

20:50.970 --> 20:52.970 position:10%,start line:85% size:80%
It's an entire transcript.

20:52.970 --> 20:55.200 position:10%,start line:85% size:80%
>> So, "I'm not asking for you
to be perfect.

20:55.200 --> 20:59.000 position:10%,start line:85% size:80%
I just... I just ask for you
to have loyalty, dedication,

20:59.000 --> 21:02.200 position:10%,start line:85% size:80%
and I want some elevation
in your situation."

21:02.200 --> 21:04.600 position:10%,start line:85% size:80%
>> He's talking about money.

21:04.600 --> 21:07.470 position:10%,start line:85% size:80%
The other part of this is
proving the person

21:07.470 --> 21:09.600 position:10%,start line:85% size:80%
behind the computer,
behind the phone,

21:09.600 --> 21:11.000 position:10%,start line:85% size:80%
behind the text messages.

21:11.000 --> 21:15.430 position:10%,start line:85% size:80%
And that's we do other things
to bolster the case,

21:15.430 --> 21:18.430 position:10%,start line:85% size:80%
and in that way, we can prove
this is the person

21:18.430 --> 21:21.230 align:left position:10%,start line:85% size:80%
that did all these things, that
I had the conversation with.

21:21.230 --> 21:22.530 position:10%,start line:85% size:80%
>> Get him in a telephone
conversation,

21:22.530 --> 21:27.670 position:10%,start line:85% size:80%
get him to purchase a,
a Greyhound ticket for me.

21:27.670 --> 21:30.900 align:left position:10%,start line:85% size:80%
Get him at the Greyhound station
picking me up.

21:30.900 --> 21:32.230 position:10%,start line:85% size:80%
Let's see here.

21:32.230 --> 21:35.030 position:10%,start line:85% size:80%
Let's see if we can get him
IDed.

21:36.730 --> 21:40.970 align:left position:10%,start line:85% size:80%
His name may not even be Chris,
let's see what we got here.

21:40.970 --> 21:42.670 position:10%,start line:85% size:80%
>> So...

21:42.670 --> 21:44.900 align:left position:10%,start line:85% size:80%
>> NARRATOR: Another one of the
men she's been talking

21:44.900 --> 21:49.370 align:left position:10%,start line:85% size:80%
to online is Dwayne Mathis, and
he has a long criminal record.

21:49.370 --> 21:52.770 position:10%,start line:85% size:80%
>> So assault, marijuana,
DV assault,

21:52.770 --> 21:55.530 position:10%,start line:85% size:80%
and then he had a couple
of robberies

21:55.530 --> 21:57.130 position:10%,start line:85% size:80%
in 2012 and 2011.

21:57.130 --> 21:58.770 position:10%,start line:85% size:80%
Armed robbery.

21:58.770 --> 22:01.330 position:10%,start line:85% size:80%
90 days is the most he's,
he's done in jail.

22:01.330 --> 22:03.530 position:10%,start line:85% size:80%
>> 90 days for armed robbery.

22:03.530 --> 22:05.300 position:10%,start line:85% size:80%
>> Yep...

22:05.300 --> 22:09.700 position:10%,start line:85% size:80%
>> So last week, on Tuesday,
I believe,

22:09.700 --> 22:13.830 position:10%,start line:85% size:80%
I get a phone call from
a sheriff's deputy

22:13.830 --> 22:15.670 position:10%,start line:85% size:80%
out of Albuquerque...

22:15.670 --> 22:17.370 position:10%,start line:85% size:80%
>> NARRATOR: The unit has been
working closely

22:17.370 --> 22:19.330 position:10%,start line:85% size:80%
with neighboring police
departments,

22:19.330 --> 22:21.200 position:10%,start line:85% size:80%
and quickly learned
that Mathis is a suspect

22:21.200 --> 22:25.630 align:left position:10%,start line:85% size:80%
in another sex trafficking case,
involving a 16-year-old girl.

22:25.630 --> 22:30.530 align:left position:10%,start line:85% size:80%
>> They located her on Backpage
here in Phoenix.

22:30.530 --> 22:33.130 position:10%,start line:85% size:80%
And I don't know the
circumstances surrounding it,

22:33.130 --> 22:34.700 position:10%,start line:85% size:80%
but according to Glendale,
they believe that

22:34.700 --> 22:36.470 position:10%,start line:85% size:80%
that 16-year-old girl out of
Albuquerque

22:36.470 --> 22:39.200 align:left position:10%,start line:85% size:80%
coincidentally works for Dwayne.

22:39.200 --> 22:41.630 position:10%,start line:85% size:80%
So we're going to have a good
child prostitution charge

22:41.630 --> 22:43.500 position:10%,start line:85% size:80%
on him, as well, which is a
class two.

22:43.500 --> 22:46.100 position:10%,start line:85% size:80%
>> You've made arrangements
with him

22:46.100 --> 22:47.430 position:10%,start line:85% size:80%
that you're coming in
tomorrow at 5:30?

22:47.430 --> 22:49.400 position:10%,start line:85% size:80%
>> Tomorrow at 5:30
on the Greyhound,

22:49.400 --> 22:51.070 align:left position:10%,start line:85% size:80%
which there will be a Greyhound
pulling in there

22:51.070 --> 22:52.600 position:10%,start line:85% size:80%
tomorrow at 5:30.
>> Okay.

22:52.600 --> 22:55.670 position:10%,start line:85% size:80%
So I can get it set up
with our FAID guys.

22:55.670 --> 22:59.170 align:left position:10%,start line:85% size:80%
>> I will have him on the phone
when he arrives tomorrow

22:59.170 --> 23:01.270 position:10%,start line:85% size:80%
to kind of solidify
everything else.

23:01.270 --> 23:02.700 align:left position:10%,start line:85% size:80%
I would want, I want him on the
phone as he's pulling in

28:51.700 --> 28:55.500 align:left position:10%,start line:85% size:80%

I couldn't do it again.

29:00.770 --> 29:06.130 align:left position:10%,start line:85% size:80%

started, it's, like, all these,

29:06.130 --> 29:07.870 position:10%,start line:85% size:80%
like, big promises, and, like,

29:07.870 --> 29:10.000 position:10%,start line:85% size:80%
"Oh, you know, you can have
whatever you want,

29:10.000 --> 29:13.330 position:10%,start line:85% size:80%
and you can travel and you can
take care of your family

and not have to worry
about anything,

29:15.630 --> 29:19.030 align:left position:10%,start line:85% size:80%

29:19.030 --> 29:23.300 align:left position:10%,start line:85% size:80%

way more than physically.

29:23.300 --> 29:28.070 align:left position:10%,start line:85% size:80%

gotten away if, if I wanted to.

You know, like, 'cause I was out

or in the room
by myself sometimes.

29:32.630 --> 29:37.670 position:10%,start line:85% size:80%

but it's, like, emotionally

29:37.670 --> 29:42.130 position:10%,start line:85% size:80%
and, and mentally, like, they
have you, like, in handcuffs.

29:42.130 --> 29:45.170 position:10%,start line:85% size:80%
It's, like, they pick the most
insecure,

29:45.170 --> 29:48.000 position:10%,start line:85% size:80%
like, or sad or, like, damaged

29:48.000 --> 29:51.300 position:10%,start line:85% size:80%
in some kind of emotional way,
like, female,

29:51.300 --> 29:53.570 position:10%,start line:85% size:80%
and then they take them,
and they just, like,

29:53.570 --> 29:56.430 align:left position:10%,start line:85% size:80%
build up their head with what...

29:56.430 --> 30:01.830 align:left position:10%,start line:85% size:80%
If you don't know what love is,
what you might perceive as love.

30:01.830 --> 30:05.700 align:left position:10%,start line:85% size:80%
Then once they get you that way,
then they flip the script,

30:05.700 --> 30:08.100 position:10%,start line:85% size:80%
and they tell you, like,
"You're mine,"

30:08.100 --> 30:10.670 position:10%,start line:85% size:80%
and, or, "This is always
what you're going to be,"

30:10.670 --> 30:12.630 position:10%,start line:85% size:80%
and, you know,
"You can't do anything else

30:12.630 --> 30:14.970 position:10%,start line:85% size:80%
and you can't ever leave,
you can't ever get away."

30:14.970 --> 30:19.330 align:left position:10%,start line:85% size:80%
Like, "I'll find you,"
and just crazy stuff, you know?

30:19.330 --> 30:21.630 position:10%,start line:85% size:80%
And, like, you believe it.

30:21.630 --> 30:26.500 align:left position:10%,start line:85% size:80%
Like, you believe what they say.

30:26.500 --> 30:31.300 position:10%,start line:85% size:80%
In that moment, like,
it sounds believable, like,

30:31.300 --> 30:35.570 align:left position:10%,start line:85% size:80%
"Nobody will love you past this,
nobody will see past this,"

30:35.570 --> 30:37.600 position:10%,start line:85% size:80%
sounds believable.

30:40.430 --> 30:43.970 position:10%,start line:85% size:80%
So you just, you just believe
it, and then you just go,

30:43.970 --> 30:46.470 position:10%,start line:85% size:80%

that things will get better,

30:46.470 --> 30:48.900 position:10%,start line:85% size:80%

35:22.170 --> 35:27.430 position:10%,start line:85% size:80%
There's a lot more fetishes

35:27.430 --> 35:30.470 position:10%,start line:85% size:80%
that's requested of the women.

35:30.470 --> 35:32.030 position:10%,start line:85% size:80%
And that scares me.

35:32.030 --> 35:34.200 position:10%,start line:85% size:80%
Just because I hear
what they're asking of me.

35:34.200 --> 35:35.800 position:10%,start line:85% size:80%
So I know they're asking the
same thing

of somebody who's
actually being trafficked.

35:38.800 --> 35:41.900 position:10%,start line:85% size:80%

they're paying for something,

35:41.900 --> 35:44.930 align:left position:10%,start line:85% size:80%
so they can use and abuse and do
whatever they want,

35:44.930 --> 35:46.570 position:10%,start line:85% size:80%
because they believe
that no one will care,

35:46.570 --> 35:50.700 align:left position:10%,start line:85% size:80%
no one will report it, nobody's
going to miss them, which,

35:50.700 --> 35:52.730 position:10%,start line:85% size:80%
unfortunately, often is true.

>> The victim's cooperation,
and Kat in this case,

40:10.870 --> 40:14.130 position:10%,start line:85% size:80%
is absolutely imperative
for us to move forward.

40:14.130 --> 40:15.930 position:10%,start line:85% size:80%
Without a victim,
there's no crime.

40:15.930 --> 40:18.600 position:10%,start line:85% size:80%
Unfortunately, that's the way
the justice system works

when we're talking
about sex trafficking.

40:20.170 --> 40:22.830 align:left position:10%,start line:85% size:80%
So if Kat was not to participate
in this case,

40:22.830 --> 40:25.500 position:10%,start line:85% size:80%
the suspects would be out,
and we'd be done.

46:51.530 --> 46:54.400 align:left position:10%,start line:85% size:80%
between trading drugs in society

46:54.400 --> 46:58.030 align:left position:10%,start line:85% size:80%
and trading victims and females,
such as the victim in this case.

46:58.030 --> 47:01.070 position:10%,start line:85% size:80%
>> Thank you.
Mr. Cisneros?

47:08.700 --> 47:12.930 align:left position:10%,start line:85% size:80%
Mr. Cisneros, anything you want
to say on your own behalf?

47:12.930 --> 47:17.200 position:10%,start line:85% size:80%
>> I don't expect
their forgiveness...

47:17.200 --> 47:21.700 position:10%,start line:85% size:80%
But I... I would like them to
know that I deeply am sorry,

47:21.700 --> 47:26.330 align:left position:10%,start line:85% size:80%
and I would like them to just be
able to move on from this.

47:26.330 --> 47:27.530 position:10%,start line:85% size:80%
>> Well, Mr. Cisneros,
unfortunately,

47:27.530 --> 47:30.500 align:left position:10%,start line:85% size:80%
I've had a number of cases like
this, um...

47:30.500 --> 47:33.600 position:10%,start line:85% size:80%
I'm frankly shocked.

47:33.600 --> 47:37.100 position:10%,start line:85% size:80%
I mean, to abduct a child and
force her

47:37.100 --> 47:41.000 position:10%,start line:85% size:80%
into committing sex acts
for money.

47:41.000 --> 47:43.830 align:left position:10%,start line:85% size:80%
Difficult to think of something
more despicable than that.

47:43.830 --> 47:47.600 position:10%,start line:85% size:80%
That's just, I mean,
it's very disturbing.

47:47.600 --> 47:48.670 position:10%,start line:85% size:80%
It's very disturbing.

47:48.670 --> 47:53.670 position:10%,start line:85% size:80%
Um, the victim in this case
described it as inhumane,

47:53.670 --> 47:56.870 align:left position:10%,start line:85% size:80%
and I think that that's, that's
a good way to describe it.

47:56.870 --> 48:00.800 position:10%,start line:85% size:80%
Um, you and your co-defendants
preyed on a child

48:00.800 --> 48:05.330 position:10%,start line:85% size:80%
and used her to make money
in the worst possible way

48:05.330 --> 48:07.470 position:10%,start line:85% size:80%
that I can think of, by
performing sex acts

48:07.470 --> 48:09.270 position:10%,start line:85% size:80%
against her will.

48:09.270 --> 48:13.230 position:10%,start line:85% size:80%
Um, it, it's, it's really
a disturbing situation,

48:13.230 --> 48:15.300 position:10%,start line:85% size:80%
as all these cases are.

48:15.300 --> 48:19.000 align:left position:10%,start line:85% size:80%
The impact that this has had on
the victim is,

48:19.000 --> 48:21.800 position:10%,start line:85% size:80%
is obviously the strongest
aggravating factor

48:21.800 --> 48:22.830 position:10%,start line:85% size:80%
in this matter.

48:22.830 --> 48:25.730 align:left position:10%,start line:85% size:80%
Um, she's going to have to live
with this the rest of her life,

48:25.730 --> 48:27.600 position:10%,start line:85% size:80%
no matter what happens.

48:27.600 --> 48:29.600 position:10%,start line:85% size:80%
This is going to be something
she is going to have to carry

48:29.600 --> 48:32.800 position:10%,start line:85% size:80%
with her, and it's going to
be a burden.

48:34.400 --> 48:37.670 position:10%,start line:85% size:80%
>> NARRATOR: The judge gave
Cisneros 24 years

48:37.670 --> 48:40.000 position:10%,start line:85% size:80%
for child sex trafficking
and other charges.

48:43.370 --> 48:46.730 position:10%,start line:85% size:80%
>> NARRATOR: At his hearing,
Rafael Quiroz was given

48:46.730 --> 48:48.470 position:10%,start line:85% size:80%
ten years,

48:48.470 --> 48:52.900 position:10%,start line:85% size:80%
and Bryant Flemate 16 years.

48:52.900 --> 48:57.500 position:10%,start line:85% size:80%
They will all be on lifetime
sex-offender probation,

48:57.500 --> 49:01.530 align:left position:10%,start line:85% size:80%
due to new anti-trafficking laws
in Arizona.

49:01.530 --> 49:05.330 position:10%,start line:85% size:80%
>> It didn't hit me until
probably, like, that night

49:05.330 --> 49:07.130 position:10%,start line:85% size:80%
at probably, like, 3:00 in the
morning, 4:00 in the morning.

49:07.130 --> 49:09.670 position:10%,start line:85% size:80%
I just started crying,
and it was over nothing,

49:09.670 --> 49:13.370 align:left position:10%,start line:85% size:80%
and it was just, like, I think
it was just my body telling me,

49:13.370 --> 49:14.370 position:10%,start line:85% size:80%
like, "You can breathe, you
know, it's, it's finally over.

49:14.370 --> 49:16.100 position:10%,start line:85% size:80%
Like, you can live your life;

49:16.100 --> 49:19.230 position:10%,start line:85% size:80%
you don't have to worry
anymore," you know?

49:22.470 --> 49:26.630 align:left position:10%,start line:85% size:80%
(siren blaring, radio squawking)

49:26.630 --> 49:29.370 align:left position:10%,start line:85% size:80%
>> NARRATOR: Since Phoenix began
its new approach

49:29.370 --> 49:31.670 position:10%,start line:85% size:80%
to sex trafficking,
it has seen victories...

49:31.670 --> 49:33.900 align:left position:10%,start line:85% size:80%
>> The longer you stay out here,
the higher the risk is.

49:33.900 --> 49:36.070 position:10%,start line:85% size:80%
>> NARRATOR: ...but also
new challenges.

49:36.070 --> 49:38.230 position:10%,start line:85% size:80%
>> So there isn't really a
centralized place

49:38.230 --> 49:42.400 align:left position:10%,start line:85% size:80%
for us to go and look right now,
to help us find the victims.

49:42.400 --> 49:45.630 align:left position:10%,start line:85% size:80%
>> NARRATOR: Backpage, the most
popular website

49:45.630 --> 49:47.500 position:10%,start line:85% size:80%
for sex traffickers,
was shut down.

49:47.500 --> 49:50.400 position:10%,start line:85% size:80%
>> So now we're just trying to
figure out,

49:50.400 --> 49:52.100 position:10%,start line:85% size:80%
um, where everybody's going.

49:52.100 --> 49:54.330 position:10%,start line:85% size:80%
So these new websites
have popped up.

49:54.330 --> 49:59.770 position:10%,start line:85% size:80%
Bedpage, which is almost an
exact replica of Backpage.

49:59.770 --> 50:03.930 position:10%,start line:85% size:80%
Then we've got OneBackpage.

50:03.930 --> 50:08.200 position:10%,start line:85% size:80%
Basically, it's all of these
different websites now

50:08.200 --> 50:11.130 align:left position:10%,start line:85% size:80%
that we don't have, um, any
agreements or search tools with,

50:11.130 --> 50:13.970 align:left position:10%,start line:85% size:80%
and they've kind of spread out.

50:13.970 --> 50:17.000 position:10%,start line:85% size:80%
So we don't have a certain
location

50:17.000 --> 50:18.670 position:10%,start line:85% size:80%
to go look for them anymore.

50:18.670 --> 50:24.100 align:left position:10%,start line:85% size:80%
And it's kind of a, a crapshoot.

50:24.100 --> 50:28.900 align:left position:10%,start line:85% size:80%
>> There always seems to be this
urgency to, to take things down,

50:28.900 --> 50:31.230 position:10%,start line:85% size:80%
to make it inconvenient
for the traffickers.

50:31.230 --> 50:34.470 align:left position:10%,start line:85% size:80%
But when you do that, there is
always unintended consequences.

50:34.470 --> 50:38.300 position:10%,start line:85% size:80%
So you take down Backpage,
and then, you know,

50:38.300 --> 50:41.300 align:left position:10%,start line:85% size:80%
there is more trafficking on the
street, it becomes more violent.

50:41.300 --> 50:44.400 position:10%,start line:85% size:80%
>> So he choked you out,
because you wouldn't work?

50:44.400 --> 50:46.630 position:10%,start line:85% size:80%
>> Yeah.
>> He come out of nowhere,

50:46.630 --> 50:48.270 position:10%,start line:85% size:80%
punched me in the jaw,
choked me.

50:48.270 --> 50:49.270 position:10%,start line:85% size:80%
>> I've been raped.

50:49.270 --> 50:50.330 position:10%,start line:85% size:80%
He did it to a gang of girls.

50:50.330 --> 50:52.300 position:10%,start line:85% size:80%
>> Just be careful of my head,

50:52.300 --> 50:53.800 position:10%,start line:85% size:80%
I got beat up real bad this
morning.

50:53.800 --> 50:55.470 align:left position:10%,start line:85% size:80%
>> You got jumped this morning?

50:55.470 --> 50:57.600 align:left position:10%,start line:85% size:80%
>> The activity out here is more

50:57.600 --> 50:59.730 position:10%,start line:85% size:80%
than we've ever seen
in our careers.

50:59.730 --> 51:02.300 align:left position:10%,start line:85% size:80%
And we're seeing a lot of girls,
young girls,

51:02.300 --> 51:04.070 position:10%,start line:85% size:80%
out here on the streets now.

51:04.070 --> 51:05.330 position:10%,start line:85% size:80%
>> What's your first name?
>> Nadia.

51:05.330 --> 51:06.770 position:10%,start line:85% size:80%
>> Nadia.

51:06.770 --> 51:09.900 position:10%,start line:85% size:80%
Honestly, hon, you don't look
like an adult to me.

51:09.900 --> 51:11.770 position:10%,start line:85% size:80%
You look very young.

51:11.770 --> 51:16.500 position:10%,start line:85% size:80%
>> Ooh, a lot of freaking cops
just for nothing.

51:16.500 --> 51:19.300 align:left position:10%,start line:85% size:80%
>> I think the thing that's
getting harder and harder for us

51:19.300 --> 51:21.830 position:10%,start line:85% size:80%
is to figure out
where victims are.

51:21.830 --> 51:24.170 position:10%,start line:85% size:80%
>> Come on out, hon.

51:24.170 --> 51:28.400 position:10%,start line:85% size:80%
>> Our work is constantly
having to shift, evolve,

51:28.400 --> 51:31.330 position:10%,start line:85% size:80%
and we are having to adapt

51:31.330 --> 51:34.700 position:10%,start line:85% size:80%
to what the traffickers are
doing with their victims.

51:34.700 --> 51:36.400 align:left position:10%,start line:85% size:80%
It's like a cat-and-mouse game.

51:36.400 --> 51:37.900 align:left position:10%,start line:85% size:80%
>> Grab her, grab her, grab her!
Hey!

51:37.900 --> 51:40.270 position:10%,start line:85% size:80%
>> She's running.

51:42.400 --> 51:45.070 align:left position:10%,start line:85% size:80%
>> I think it's the
old-fashioned cops and robbers.

51:45.070 --> 51:49.600 position:10%,start line:85% size:80%
We're reacting, obviously, and
we're going to change

51:49.600 --> 51:52.900 position:10%,start line:85% size:80%
with how they change, but the
wheel goes round and round

51:52.900 --> 51:54.870 position:10%,start line:85% size:80%
in law enforcement.

51:54.870 --> 51:57.370 position:10%,start line:85% size:80%

guy for two or three days now?

51:57.370 --> 52:00.370 position:10%,start line:85% size:80%

but he said not till 9:00,
